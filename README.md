## Getting Started
1. Install  bundler:`sudo gem install bundler`. Bundler is a Ruby tool that manages Ruby packages, known as gems.

2. Run `bundle update` which will download any gems declared in the Gemfile.

Note: When using Fastlane commands, adding `bundle exec` beforehand means that youâ€™ll get the exact version of a gem that you specified in your Gemfile, instead of a different version installed elsewhere on your computer.
